Toronto Train System Circuit Board
------
I saw a [New York City Subway PCB Map](https://www.traintrackr.io/product/mta2) and thought, "Hey, I could make one of these for Toronto!" So I did! 

It's just a bunch of addressable RGB LEDs in sequence controlled by an Arduino Nano. I designed it in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) which is a free circuit board designing software.

2-Player Arcade Machine
------
I grew up on old Nintendo consoles and arcade machines, so I've always wanted to build one myself. I built this one with a Raspberry Pi and some lasercut wood which I painted and doodled some classic characters on the outside. It can emulate any game - but usually gets used for Street Fighter II duels (which I win).
