Toronto Train System Circuit Board
------
I saw a [New York City Subway PCB Map](https://www.traintrackr.io/product/mta2) and thought, "Hey, I could make one of these for Toronto!" So I did! 

It's just a bunch of addressable RGB LEDs in sequence controlled by an Arduino Nano. I designed it in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) which is a free circuit board designing software.

Mechatronics Engineering Capstone Symposium
------
On March 18th, we had our Mechatronics Engineering Capstone Project Symposium, where everyone in my class gathered to showcase their final projects. This day is pretty much the climax of the Mechatronics Engineering program at the University of Waterloo! So, I went around and filmed every group and interviewed a few of my classmates.

2-Player Arcade Machine
------
I grew up on old Nintendo consoles and arcade machines, so I've always wanted to build one myself. I built this one with a Raspberry Pi and some lasercut wood which I painted and doodled some classic characters on the outside. It can emulate any game - but usually gets used for Street Fighter II duels (which I win).

Autonomous Sailboat Team
-----
I was a mechanical lead on the Autonomous Sailboat team, where I helped teach new members how to give shape to carbon fibre using a mold. This is a useful skill in making a small autonomous sailboat, as carbon fibre is an ideal material for the body of the boat since it is so strong and lightweight.
