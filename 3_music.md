music
======
Music is awesome! I try learning every instrument I can get my hands on and love trying to learn new techniques or styles. My current favourite instruments to play are bass and guitar. I also enjoy playing drums and sometimes clarinet. Maybe the odd banjo too. And theremin.

------
I wrote a co-wrote a musical comedy about climate change and hope with my dad and my high school music teacher. It was really fun! You can watch the entire thing performed live here:

30-Country International Virtual Choir
------
It's a long story, but I got 134 people from 30 different countries to come together virtually to sing "We're Here Because We're Here" as a message of hope and endurance during the pandemic. It was really cool and I'm super thankful to everyone who participated!

Cloning Myself
-----
I've long been inspired by [Jacob Collier's videos](https://youtu.be/mJR6XSSKi-g?t=12) where it looks like he's playing in a band with a bunch of clones of himself. I decided to try that out myself!
